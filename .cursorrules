MANDATORY RULES (ENFORCED)

Before making ANY changes:
- You MUST read docs/WORKING_RULES.md.
- You MUST comply with all rules in that document.
- You MUST confirm compliance before proceeding.

HARD STOPS
- If docs/WORKING_RULES.md is missing, unclear, or conflicting:
  - STOP immediately.
  - Ask the user for clarification.
  - Do NOT modify code.

GLOBAL USER CONTEXT
- The user is NOT a developer.
- The user acts as Product Manager / Product Owner.
- The user cannot read or review code.
- Never ask the user to review diffs, files, or technical decisions.

SCOPE CONTROL
- Prefer safe, incremental changes.
- Work on ONE functional flow at a time.
- Avoid large refactors unless explicitly approved.
- Restricted areas (deployment, Firebase, API keys, hosting, index.html) require explicit approval.
