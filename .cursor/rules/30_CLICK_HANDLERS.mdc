# CLICK HANDLERS — CAPTURE PHASE RULES

This project uses a capture-phase click handler on document.body.

---

## MANDATORY RULES
- Use data-* attributes for targets (e.g. data-close)
- Do NOT rely on classes alone
- All decorative children (SVG, span, icon):
  → pointer-events: none

---

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
- Close / sheet logic FIRST in handleClick
- Before any stopPropagation or other logic

---

## VERIFICATION
- Click the CENTER of the element
- If only the edge works → bug
