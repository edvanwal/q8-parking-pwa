# BROWSER VERIFICATION — SELF-CHECK REQUIRED

After ANY frontend/UI change:
- you MUST verify your own work in the browser
- using browser automation (MCP or Playwright)

Do NOT ask the user to do this.

---

## REQUIREMENTS
- Determine the correct local URL/port from the project (e.g. package.json scripts, SYSTEM_STATUS.md, or docs/MASTER.md — use whichever exists).
- If the project serves a static public folder locally, a typical approach is e.g. `npx serve public -l 3000`; treat this as a fallback example, not a universal mandate.
- Navigate, click, scroll as a human would.
- Verify visible behavior, not just state.

---

## PROCESS
1. Start or use the running app at the project’s local URL.
2. Navigate to the app, perform the changed flow.
3. Confirm expected UI behavior.
4. If incorrect: fix and repeat.
