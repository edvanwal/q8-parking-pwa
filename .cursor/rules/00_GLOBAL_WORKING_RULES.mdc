# GLOBAL WORKING RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These rules exist to stop "tests green, human broken" and agent drift.

## 1) ALWAYS start here
- You MUST read and follow all canonical rules in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`.
- If any rule conflicts with your plan, STOP and fix the plan.

## 2) No assumptions
- If you are unsure, you MUST inspect the repo and cite exact file paths and snippets.
- Do not guess ports, routes, selectors, or behaviors.

## 3) Minimal change, maximum proof
- Prefer the smallest correct fix that addresses the root cause.
- Provide visible proof (headed, trace/video/screenshots) whenever the rules require it.

## 4) Human first, not "code first"
- Assertions must match what a human sees (text, visibility, enabled/disabled, overlays open/closed).
- Avoid internal flags or hidden state as the main proof.

## 5) Stop on uncertainty
- If something is unclear, write it as TBD with file references.
- Do not "paper over" gaps.

## 6) Discipline
- Every decision that changes long-term behavior must be documented (ADR light if needed).
- Every repeated issue is a process bug and MUST be expanded so this cannot happen again
