# GIT AND COMMIT DISCIPLINE

We keep history clean and changes reviewable.

## MANDATORY
- Keep changes scoped. Do not mix unrelated changes.
- If you need to do multiple things, split into separate commits.

## BEFORE COMMIT
- Run the relevant checks (proof, smoke, lint/format if present) and report results.
- Summarize what changed and why in human terms.

## COMMIT MESSAGE
- Use clear prefixes where sensible (fix:, chore:, docs:, test:).
- Mention the area (e.g. e2e, rules, docs) so history is searchable.

## NO SURPRISES
- Do not introduce extra files or refactors unless required by the task.
- If conflicts happen, explain resolution and keep intent minimal.

## VERIFICATION
- For UI changes: verify in browser and ensure proof gates are respected.
- For logic/backend change: Tests pass or you have repro + fix + verification evidence.
